Last year I have visited a state in India named Kerala which was one of the most beautiful place I have ever seen. 
The whole state was covered my greenery and mountains but the best city was munnar there were a lots of tea gardens and it looked wonderfull.
There they showed us how to make tea not only that but we also visited the factory where tea was produced from tea leafs.
There was a place named rose garden which was very beautiful.
